# 👨‍🍳 Chuks Kitchen

A high-fidelity frontend implementation of the Chuks Kitchen food delivery platform. This project was developed as part of an internship challenge at Trueminds Innovations, focusing on the rigorous translation of complex Figma designs into a functional, responsive, and type-safe React application.

## 📋 Project Overview

The core objective was to demonstrate "Design-to-Code" proficiency by implementing a minimum of 5 pages from a 12-page Figma specification. I successfully delivered 5 core pages with full mobile responsiveness, prioritizing pixel-perfection and clean architectural patterns.

### Pages Implemented:

- Onboarding/Welcome: Initial brand entry point with optimized image assets.

- Sign In: User authentication interface with custom form logic.

- Sign Up: Registration interface featuring reusable input components.

- Home: A dashboard-style landing page with featured highlights.

- Menu/Explore: A complex listing page featuring advanced filtering and search.

***Note: Account, Cart, and Contact pages are planned for future development.***

## 🚀 Key Features & Logic

Advanced Category Filtering
The menu features a specialized filtering system. While the data is hard-coded, the logic is built to handle complex relationships:

Virtual Categories: Implemented "Popular" as a functional filter. Even though "Popular" isn't a food group, the system identifies items with the isPopular flag.

Grouped Rendering: When the "Popular" filter is active, the UI dynamically groups items by their actual category (e.g., "Popular in Jollof Rice") using .reduce() and Object.entries().

Reusable Component Architecture
Custom Auth Inputs: Developed a single AuthInput component that handles password toggles, dynamic icons, and validation states without code duplication.

Responsive Navbar: A hybrid navigation system that uses a desktop NavigationMenu and a mobile Sheet (Drawer) for optimal UX.

## 🧠 Challenges Overcome

🧩 Interpreting Design Ambiguity
The Figma design presented "Popular" as a sibling to food categories like "Swallows." I identified that this would lead to a poor user experience if rendered as a flat list. I improvised a Grouped View logic that maintains the menu's structure while highlighting top-rated items, turning a design ambiguity into a functional feature.

🎨 Mastering Shadcn UI
As this was my first time using Shadcn, I faced a steep learning curve in customizing component styles without "breaking" the underlying Radix primitives.

- Solution: I utilized Tailwind’s cn() utility and learned to extend Shadcn's base styles via class-variance-authority (CVA), allowing for heavy customization while maintaining the integrity of the library.

📱 Responsive Layouts
Matching 5 pages across both Mobile and Desktop required deep use of Tailwind’s grid and flexbox systems, specifically handling the "line-height" gaps in images and ensuring uniform card heights in the menu grid regardless of content length.
